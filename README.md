# BugFixes
 1 - String Formatting Issues <br />
    - I added recipeNameFormatter method in Util class to fix the bug. <br />
    - I also added below in recipe_row.xml file <br />
            android:ellipsize="end" <br />
            android:singleLine="true" <br />
 2 - I removed unnecessary code in RecipeListAdapter <br />
 3 - I fixed the viewmodel and pagination issues. <br />
 4 - I updated the timeFormatter method in Util class to fix NullPointerException error.  I also updated time format <br />
<br />
 Note-1 : I removed the fragment to keep the code simple and added RecipeRepository to abstract data model from viewmodel <br />
 Note-2 : Removed the API KEY but if you add the one you shared to me, the app works as expected. <br />
